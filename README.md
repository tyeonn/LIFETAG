#CUNY Hackathon 2017
# LIFETAG
Medical application created by Pawandeep Singh, Alexander Melo, Debashish Karmaker, Timothy Wu, and Junhao Chen.  
Application is to be used by first responders to triage patients during times of mass casualty incidents.  
LifeTag allows them to quickly triage people and send real-time status to the hospitals.  
Hospitals will have a separate UI which allows them to see the symptoms instantly and choose to accept the patients.  
First responders will know exactly where to send the patients without worrying about space availability or treatment options of the hospitals.
